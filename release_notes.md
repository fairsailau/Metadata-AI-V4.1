# Release Notes - Box Metadata AI V4.1 Fixed V4

## Overview
This release addresses critical issues with structured metadata extraction in the Box Metadata AI application, fixes UI accessibility warnings, and preserves all the enhanced features from previous versions.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Structured Metadata Extraction
- **Root Cause Identified**: The application was sending an invalid `ai_agent.type` value of "ai_agent_extract" in API requests
- **Solution Implemented**: Completely removed the `ai_agent` field from structured metadata extraction requests, allowing Box to use the default agent
- **Benefits**: Eliminates 400 Bad Request errors by simplifying the API request format

### 2. UI Accessibility Warnings
- **Root Cause Identified**: Many UI elements had empty labels, triggering accessibility warnings
- **Solution Implemented**: Added proper non-empty labels with `label_visibility="collapsed"` where needed
- **Benefits**: Eliminates "label got an empty value" warnings while maintaining the same visual appearance

### 3. Document Categorization Navigation
- Maintained the "Continue to Document Categorization" button in the File Browser page
- Ensured proper navigation flow between file selection and document categorization

## Technical Improvements

### API Request Format
- Simplified API requests by removing unnecessary fields
- Used correct property names (`template_key` instead of `templateKey`)
- Ensured all required type fields are included in metadata templates

### Code Quality
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added comprehensive documentation and test plans

## Documentation
- Added detailed API documentation with precise requirements
- Included test plan with exact API specifications
- Documented best practices for Box AI API integration

## Installation
Simply extract the zip file and run the application using Streamlit:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.10+

## Known Issues
- Processing very large batches (100+ files) may encounter API rate limits
